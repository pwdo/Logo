Logo Usage
===

### Avoid the horizontal logo
We strongly recommend using the [square](https://github.com/pwdo/Logo/blob/master/pwdo-logo-square.png) "Philippine Web Designers" logo over the horizontal "PWDO" logo so that it is more descriptive. 

### Use the dark square logo if the background is not light 
If you're using a dark or photographic background, please opt for the [dark square](https://github.com/pwdo/Logo/blob/master/pwdo-logo-dark-square.png) logo.
